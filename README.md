## CLI Commands

_ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: If you use Mac, I highly recommend using [Warp](https://warp.dev) for your CLI. It's an amazing dev experience, and it has a really convenient feature called [Workflows](https://docs.warp.dev/features/warp-drive/workflows) which can save your bash commands, even parametrizing certain parts as variables â€” super useful if you know you'll be frequently reusing the same / similar commands!_
